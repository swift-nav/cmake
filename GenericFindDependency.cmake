#
# A generic cmake function to search for a dependency from several places and
# include in the build system as appropriate
#
# Dependencies can be picked up either from bundled source code, usually a git
# submodule located in the 'third_party' directory, or from libraries installed
# in the host system or cross compiling sysroot.
#
# By default dependencies are first sought in bundled source code, and if not
# found from the system libraries. This default behaviour can be controlled by 
# several options
#
# EXCLUDE - can be used to disable searching in a particular location. Valid
#   arguments are 'source' and 'system'
# PREFER - used to override the default search location. Valid arguments are
#   'source' and 'system'. If not specified defaults to 'source'
#
# Similar options can be specified on the command line as well.
# SWIFT_PREFERRED_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE takes the same arguments as above but
# will apply globally across the entire build tree at configure time. For example
#
# cmake -DSWIFT_PREFERRED_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE=system <path>
#
# will try to use dependencies from the system libraries rather than bundled
# source code.
#
# If the dependency is picked up from the system libraries this function will
# create an interface target which can be used to link in to any other target.
#
# The options "SYSTEM_HEADER_FILE" and "SYSTEM_LIB_NAMES" will be passed verbatim
# to the cmake functions find_header() and find_library() to search all the 
# correct system locations.
#
# When using bundled source code the function will search several default locations
# under '${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/third_party' based on the package and target
# names. The search location can be controlled by the "SOURCE_DIR" parameter
#
# The target name can be controlled by the option "TARGET". When using 
# bundled source code this is used to verify the target was created properly
# after calling add_subdirectory. If the add_subdirectory exposes a number of
# other targets, you can use the "ADDITIONAL_TARGETS" option to list them, this
# function will apply the "SYSTEM_INCLUDES" option to each of the targets.
#
# Passing the option SYSTEM_INCLUDES will rewrite the target include directories
# so that they are marked as system headers. This will usually be passed to
# the compiler as an command line option as decided by cmake. Be careful with
# this option, it will suppress warning which might otherwise be helpful.
#
# The option REQUIRED can be passed which will cause this function to fail
# if the dependency was not found for any reason.
#
# Example: FindGoogletest.cmake
#
# GenericFindDependency(
#    TARGET gtest
#    SOURCE_DIR "googletest"
#    SYSTEM_INCLUDES
#    )

      # Function arguments are automatically parsed out in to numbered variables
      # ARG#, and a complete argument list is stored in ARGN. Variables are passed
      # down the function call stack until they are overwritten. This allows a 
      # badly written function to test for the existance of an optional variable
      # in it's own argument list but actually pick up a variable for a function
      # much higher up the call stack.
      #
      # This behaviour has been observed in benchmark (included from grpc) in
      # the add_cxx_compiler_flag function. It has an optional second argument
      # and tests it against an empty string. This test will work if the project
      # is included in the build tree via a call to add_subdirectory outside any
      # function calls (ie. directly from CMakeLists.txt) but has the potential
      # to fail when called from within a another function, such as is happening
      # here.
      #
      # This is a very ugly way of mitigating the error. We manually unset all
      # the cmake variable related to function arguments immediately before 
      # including the dependency project. This will make it APPEAR as though
      # add_subdirectory was called from outside a function or macro.
      #
      # Note the limitation, argument lists are apparently unlimited, we are only
      # unsetting the first 100 argument variables. This will probably be enough 
      # as I haven't seen functions taking that many arguments, but it certainly
      # isn't bulletproof. Cmake doesn't appear to have any functionality which
      # could be used to achieve this so we are left with few, if any, other options.
      #
      # In this instance it is safe to unset all the function argument variables.
      # We have already called cmake_parse_arguments to separate them out in to
      # other variable which we use instead of the function argument variables
      # directly. Should this function be extended in the future it will be fine
      # so long as it carries on using to parsed variable (everything beginning
      # with "x_".
      #
      # Additionally, cmake variable are only propogated down the stack, not up
      # (unless PARENT_SCOPE is used in set()) so by unsetting variables here we
      # won't affect whatever function called us, or anything even higher up
